I am working as Japanese language Translator, Interpretator and Trainer since last 5 years.
Unlike other professional when I started to learn Japanese, the aim was to communicate effectively with people
during my stay in Japan. I had opportunity to stay in Japan around 4 years and as the time past, I developed my love towards Japanese
culture &amp; lanaguage which lead me to choose this langauge as a profession.<br />
I completed my N2 level Japanese lanaguage training in Japan and was active in various cultural activities. I
conducted various inter-cultural seminars and worked as a visiting lectuer in the University, City Hall.
After comming back to India, I had continued learning the language and acquired (2 year) Special diploma from Pune
university and certification in Business Japanese Proficiency.<br />
Currently I am located in Banglore - India and available for freelance projects as interpretator or trainer. I
also offer online private or group lessons till N2 level, if you are interested please contact me or send your
enquiries <a  class="w3-hover-text-green" href="#contact">here</a>.
